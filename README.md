# Xora - 3D Portfolio

Xora is a 3D portfolio project built using modern web technologies to showcase interactive 3D animations and designs. This project leverages the power of **Three.js**, **React Three Fiber**, **GSAP**, and **Framer Motion** for stunning animations and smooth user interactions.

## Features

- **Three.js**: For creating and rendering 3D graphics.
- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js, making it easier to integrate 3D scenes into React components.
- **GSAP**: For advanced timeline-based animations.
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth and declarative animations in React.

## Getting Started
